<p>原标题：<em><strong>A Fictive Ecology: Natural resource for reource-heavy realities</strong></em></p>
<br>
<p>Eschewing normative definitions pertaining to the bionomics of technology, <em>Ecologies excursion</em> participants select and define key materials with which to construct a new ecology.</p>

<p><strong>Stone - Jonathan Kemp（移位寄存器小组)</strong><br>
石头不仅记录了地球上的组成部分的相互作用，而且还记录了这个划时代的地球 - 实验室的运作方式。 Stone记录了过去和现在的环境，预测了未来的环境（地球作为媒体），它的aeonic历史通过与人类的相互作用呈指数地变化，它具有长期记忆，具有反映格式化，暴露于地球表面和非线性叠加的应力历史 通过衰变和人类剥削的变化，这种纠缠 - 地质学，地貌学和文明都重叠 - 使石头成为自己的病理记录器，但其中等同性标志着阅读石头书写的困难。</p>
<p><strong>堆肥 - Shu Lea Cheang（菌丝网络协会）</strong><br>
堆肥作为一种行为，一个演员，行动，活跃。 堆肥，如加工，腐烂，成熟。 它工作和重新设计其下面的多个自我，模糊分裂，驯服遗忘。 弄脏你的手，把你的裤子放下来，小便，小便，嗅闻，嗅闻，不要扼杀它。 堆肥作为凌乱的碎片 - 在年底腐烂的沉闷感觉，发酵的神志不清的上升，令人陶醉的添加剂高。 堆肥注释，堆肥复合，堆肥成型。 种子埋在豆芽下，悄悄地冲到现场，令人信服地宣布自己的到来。 由友好的混合，堆肥永远不会死。</p>
<p><strong>锗 - 杰米艾伦（移位寄存器）</strong><br>
地球上丰富的硅是行星凝聚的偶然结果，是宇宙乳液的选择性离心聚结。 早期的电子研究人员首选锗，更难提取和稀缺（即昂贵），因为它允许更快的切换和更低的电压阈值，降低能耗和电路尺寸。 条顿人元素被用于肖克利的第一个半传导演示，并且它已经成为“信息经济”的基础，在锡林浩特和诺桑比亚等地区的高等级矿床将成为靴子。工程师正在重新审视Ge作为粉碎的方式。 硅计算的玻璃天花板，打破了摩尔的劝阻规律。</p>
<p><strong>Stone - Jonathan Kemp(Shift Register)</strong><br>
Stone register not only the interplay of earth-on-earth components, but also the workings of this epochal earth-sacle-laboratory. Stone records past and present environments, premediates future ones(earth as media), and its aeonic history exponentially shifts through its interactions whith humans, It has a long memory with stress histories that reflect formatation, exposure on the earth’s surface, and the nonlinear superimposition of change through decay and human exploitation, Such an entanglement-where geology, geomorphology and civilization all overlap-makes stone its own pathological recorder, but one where equifinality marks the diffculty in reading the writing of the stones.</p>
<p><strong>Compost - Shu Lea Cheang(Mycelium Network Society)</strong><br>
Compost as an act, an actor, action, active. Compost as in processing, decaying,maturing. It works and reworks its multiple selves disposed under, blurs the divides, tames the oblivion. Get your hands dirty, your trousers down, piss on it, piss in it, smell it, sniff it, just don’t stifle it. Compost as messy mettters–that rotten sunken feeling at year end, that fermenting delirious rising, that intoxicating additive high. Compost annotated, compost composite, compost ferformative. Seeds buried under bean sprouts, bursting assertively onto the scene, convincingly annouceing their own arrival. Blended by the friendly kinds, compost never dies.</p>
<p><strong>Germanium - Jamie Allen (Shift register)</strong><br>
The earthly abundance of silicon is the contingent result of planetary condensation, the selective, centrifugal coalescence of a cosmic emulsion. Germanium, harder to extract and scarce (that is, expensive), was preferred by early electronics researchers as it allows for faster switching and lower voltage threshold, reduceing energy consumption and circuit size. The Teutonic element was used in Shockley’s first demo of semi-conduction and had it become the basic of the &quot;information  economy,” high-grade deposits in places like Xilinhaote and Northumbria would be bootowns. Engineers are revisiting Ge as a way to smash the glass ceiling of silicon computation, breaking Moore’s dicouraging law.</p>

<h3 id="艺术超越艺术"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#艺术超越艺术"></a> 艺术超越艺术</h3>
<p>1.The definition of ‹art beyond art› amounts to a negation of an understanding of art that is based on accumulative and historically linear findings. Interest focuses no longer on the autonomy of a work of art, a subject much discussed during modernism (and already wholly assimilated into contemporary art), but on art’s emancipation from art itself. This shift implies that the modernist tendency to take issue with the arguments of a discourse within the discourse itself has been overcome. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> It also signifies the demand for a ‹reconstruction of the area› on new foundations which place in question several of its basic theoretical generalizations and many of its methods.<br>
1.“超越艺术的艺术”的定义等于否定了基于累积性和历史性线性发现的对艺术的理解。 兴趣不再集中在艺术作品的自主性上，而艺术作品在现代主义中被大量讨论过（并且已经完全被同化到当代艺术中），而是从艺术本身解放出来。 这种转变意味着现代主义倾向于在话语内部讨论话语的论点已经被克服。 这也意味着需要在新的基础上进行&lt;重建该地区&gt;，这引起了一些基本的理论概括和许多方法的问题。<br>

<p>The argument of the essays can be summarized as follows: explanations delivered by art are constitutively neither reductionist nor transcendental; the function of art consists in expanding realities, knowledge and experiences; this process can take its course dialogically or consensually (through seduction), or by means of canonization (through control or coercion). Further paradigm shifts specifically relevant to media art will be examined below.</p>
<h2 id="interdisciplinarity"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#interdisciplinarity"></a> Interdisciplinarity</h2>
<p>Media art—in its diverse forms ranging from audiovisual installations to interactive systems, from hypermedia to artificial reality, from the net to cyberspace—reinforces the idea of ‹interdisciplinarity,› which reaches much further than the aforementioned considerations about the relationship of art and technology. In the context of interdisciplinarity, the intermeshing of art, technologies, and science refers to the process that brings about convergence, interference, appropriation, overlapping and interpenetration; a process successively leading to the generation of referential networks and reciprocal— non-hierarchic—influences.</p>
<h2 id="ubiquity-and-dematerialization"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#ubiquity-and-dematerialization"></a> Ubiquity and dematerialization</h2>
<p>After the exodus of art from conventional presentation spaces such as museums or galleries and the conquest of public places, streets, towns, landscapes (e.g. Land Art, Performance, Happening), the fact that spatiotemporal expansion and the wider use of materials arrived at a deeper significance of ubiquity (the possibility of being present at all place at once or simultaneously), dematerialization (independence of the physical-material existence of the object) and participation (the use of interactive network resources) is without doubt brought about by the deployment of so-called new media—such as the telecommunications system.</p>
<p>All of the telecommunications projects developed from the 1970s onward, such as those of satellite art, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> were basically attempts to transform the medium into a meta-medium permitting art spatial and temporal ubiquity. That was what gave Nam June Paik, for example, the idea that a work could be created in several different places at once, as outlined in the score «Do it yourself» in 1961. Paik’s efforts to accomplish meta-communication led to his most important contributions to satellite art, such as in 1977 «Nine Minutes Live,» his direct satellite telecast of performances in Europe and the USA for the opening of the Documenta 6 in Kassel, and in 1984 «Good Morning Mr. Orwell,» organized jointly by the Centre Pompidou and the broadcaster WNET-TV, with whichPaik succeeded in realizing a live satellite program that was participative as well as simultaneous. According to Paik, satellite art was destined to become the most important non-material work <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> in post-industrial society.</p>
<p>The formation of international projects in the 1970s was a crucial stimulus for art in conjunction with telecommunication as well as for the notion of ubiquity. The Brazilian Waldemar Cordeiro, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> a pioneer of Computer Art, in 1971 identified the inadequacy of communications media as a form of information transmission and the inefficiency of information as language, thought, and action as being the causes of the crisis of contemporary art. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> Cordeiro asserted in his Manifest Arteônica <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> that art whose main emphasis lies on the material object restricts audience access to the work and therefore meets the cultural standards of modern society neither qualitatively nor quantitatively. Cordeiro’s deliberations in regard to global networking and free, telecommunication-enabled audience access to a work of art anticipated the notion of ubiquity, participation, and net art. The main object of interest at the time was to examine the methodologies and strategies that might enable the visions of telecommunication and ubiquity to be implemented in practice. In Spain, one of the first experiments of the kind was Antoni Muntadas’ project «Cadaqués Canal Local» (1974). Establishing a live connection between various artists at the two remote locations of New York and San Francisco, the live satellite transmission of «Two Way-Demo» in 1977, an action organized by a group led by Willoughby Sharp, Liza Bear, Sharon Grace and Carl Loeffler, was another interesting example.</p>
<p>Many Telecommunication Art experiments were concerned less with purely aesthetic results than with making innovative proposals for the development of different creative and social forms in handling new media. That was the objective of «The World in 24 Hours,» a project devised by Robert Adrian X for the 1982 Ars Electronica Festival in Linz. In the view of Robert Adrian X such works surrendered their object character through being telecast, and so became «documentary traces of an action.» Other projects, such as «Electronic Cafe International,» developed byKit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz for the Olympic Arts Festival of Los Angeles in 1984, or «Piazza Virtuale» by the Gruppe Ponton/Van Gogh TV, attempted to intensify the idea of meeting and dialogue with and between the audience. Thus it is the audience that fluidly and interactively generates the ‹content› of the works. The lack of guidelines and instructions, of presenters and commentators, of completed scripts and concepts produced extremely dynamic effects. The intention of Van Gogh TV is to generate precisely these effects of non-linear and non-discursive production of information in order to create non-commercial, interactive television that is wholly separate from corporate systems of power or control. Thus, several functions are fulfilled by the users: they are simultaneously audience, contributors, and actors. This implies a double role as observer of the ‹spectacle› that is underway and as co-creator of the information. They are at once users and generators of the networks.</p>
<p>A representative number of telematic projects take into consideration the net-specific character of user participation, which largely likewise determines their conceptual and aesthetic development. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup> An important basic feature of web-art works is a hypertextual, non-linear network structure that determines the user’s manner of movement (navigation) into the project by clicking links and by scrolling. Thus, direct viewer intervention in the work is not permitted, since skipping pages triggers programmed changes—a process that is usually less experimental in regard to the mode of expression, and trivial in regard to surfing, or leads to formal, aestheticist tendencies (web formalism). In contrast to these works, net art or network projects are technically, conceptually and functionally dependent on the network apparatus and on user participation which by technical means can effect changes in, and so actively contribute to, the system and process alike.</p>
<p>The version of the work «Z» produced in 2003 by Antoni Abad attempts to create a communication network that spreads independently of a central server. Every fly is at once receiver and transmitter. At the end of the project the source code is distributed to horizontal communities interested in creating communication networks and distributed information.The novel aspect of such projects is the idea that artist or work are no longer the sole nucleation points of reception and transmission; instead, the dissemination of codes in the form of an agent turns the users into the nodal points of reciprocal relationships and multiplicators. Thus, the existence of the agents and the users as nexus depends on their reciprocal communication. This raises new and specific questions about the network and the system, as well as about the latter’s aesthetics, which is shaped into self-organized community awareness through the re-organization of the model of sociality based on individualism within a network. In order to obtain this effect, the artist deliberately surrenders control of his work and passes it on to the user as far as action and intervention for the performance and enhancement of the system is concerned. On the other hand, the continuity of the work is dependent on the intercommunication between users and the progressive generation of a flexible, network-like architecture of contacts that disseminates the platform and constantly produces new communities.</p>
<p>This complex process and the experience of mobility and variability directly influence the notions of reality and materiality, which become equally flexible, variable, and capable of virtualization. The Internet provides clear examples of the different realities and of the tendency toward transformation or simulation of the real in virtual space (‹virtual› here in the sense of suspending reality). The fluidity and playfulness of the experience in this space intensifies the feeling of timelessness and immateriality. A consideration of the various artistic Internet projects reveals that subverting the notion of reality is one of the subjects most frequently tackled by artists. Chat rooms and MUDs as well as virtual cities can similarly be regarded as platforms for the creation of artificial realities.</p>
<p>However divergent the views reflected in the most recent treatises on the ‹aesthetics of dematerialization,› and here specifically the ‹aesthetics of vanishing›—for example, in the writings of Jean-François Lyotard, Jean Baudrillard, Johannes Birringer, Paul Virilio, Peter Weibel, Vilém Flusser and Peter Zec—there are unanimous references to the «chronochratic process» (Peter Weibel) underway in contemporary society and its effects on humanperception, artificial acceleration, physical and material disintegration, and spatial simulation.</p>
<p>In his emblematic 1985 exhibition <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> in the Centre Pompidou in Paris, Jean-François Lyotard intensively analyzed this process which leads to what he calls «immaterials.» The show «Les Immatériaux» attempted to demonstrate the kind of transformation undergone by the relationship between human and material, beginning with the Modern tradition—itself heir to the Cartesian tradition—and continuing up to Postmodernism with its ‹new materials› above all in the areas of the techno-sciences, computer science, and electronics. According to Lyotard, in the process of interaction material vanishes as an independent unit (electronic waves, sound waves, light waves, elementary particles). Thus, the principle of the operational structure is based not on a stable ‹substance,› but on a series of unstable interactions. These immaterials are joined by new processes of interaction that change the way one acts in the world, and thus at the same time the human projects, too (art, philosophy, sociology, science).</p>
<p>Paul Virilio and Peter Weibel describe this process of dematerialization as an ‹era of absence› that brings forth an aesthetics based on the ‹absum,› <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> in its meaning of remoteness and spatial distance, as well as on lack, loss, and dematerialization. Media artists took up the experiences conveyed in the first discernible artistic signs of an aesthetics of absence <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> —particularly since 1945 (Fontana, Manzoni, Klein, Cage and others already mentioned)—as well as the tendency to dematerialize the artistic object, along with other strategies of immateriality that dominated the art and theory of the 1960s and ’70s (as analyzed by Frank Popper in his book «Le déclin de l’objet» of 1975, which already pointed out the process of dematerialization and the dissolution of the art object). If one considers the changes driven forward by the technologies, then these experiences are expressed even more clearly.</p>
<p>That messages circulate without message carriers—codified and by means of electromagnetic waves—or that signs and information travel the globe in disembodied form at speeds allowing them to be practically ubiquitously and simultaneously present are, according to Peter Weibel, the reasons that the worldand the human being are experiencing a process of relativization in consequence of which the state of things is changing of its own volition. If the duplication of time and space by simulation is turning real time and natural space into interchangeable quantities, then this, according to Weibel, also places in question the body itself. Telematics, for instance, allows the body ubiquitous telepresence as long as physical absence is guaranteed. Through technological transformation and artificial prosthesis the body, as the central element for understanding reality, is gradually moving away from its historical representation. Even if the body is characterized on the net by its absence, it can still be symbolically or imaginatively very much ‹present.› So-called »Telepresence Art« <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> exemplifies this process. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> It examines the possibilities of telematic media and telerobotic <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> technologies in regard to developing forms of co-existence in the real and virtual space of actions carried out synchronously by artists and users and characterized by the duality of physical and immaterial presence. One example is «Rara Avis» (1996) by Eduardo Kac, a telepresence installation that exists both physically at the exhibition site as well as on the Internet. This implies two modes of participation: locally with data spectacles, remotely over the net.</p>
<p>The net-art work «Bodyscan» (1997) by Eva Wohlgemuth is an other example of the loss of significance of (biological) material as a paradigm of reality. It consists of the image of the artist’s digitized body, which begins to ‹live› through the visitor’s gaining access to its interior. The body’s transformation into a virtual-topographic zone, a field of research, is furthermore congruent with the post-biological ideas held by various artists.</p>
<p>The artist Stelarc proposes a transition from the biological individual to «cyber system» by means of a new project of the body, i.e. a new project of the human. In his view, the application of bio-compatible microtechnology to and in the human body makes it possible to break through biological boundaries. The deeper technology penetrates the body, the more invisible it becomes. While in the «surgical performances» of the French artist Orlan the assault on physical integrity by microsurgery molds the ‹surface› of the body and attacks the identification ofsubject with body, of appearance with identity, in Stelarc’s case the assault is launched by the extension of the limb and organ functions by technical instruments. His «metaformances» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup> inevitably imply the performance (in the literal sense) of the technical prostheses he employs. In works like «Ping Body» (1995–1998), the body vanishes as an instrument of action: the (virtual) phantom body, the user participating in physical absence, and the machine realize the «metaformance» over the Internet. «Ping Body» is a good example of extreme absence insofar as the body becomes a hollow object, a host offering itself for the projections and interventions of remote assistants. By creating a body on the network that Internet users can ‹inhabit› and manipulate, Stelarc is ultimately drafting a new conception of identity and awareness of one’s own reality: the body is at once subject and object; it is no longer a closed functional system but a reception medium and interface between subject and observer, subject and context, subject and machine.</p>
<p>These processes of dematerialization (of the body, of the subject) affect the concepts of reality and truth from another perspective. In regard to art the restructuring and redefinition of these three basic concepts—subject (body), reality and truth—are the premises for an aesthetic reflection on media art. Originality versus multiplicity and simulation The profound changes which digital technology brought about in art affect the production and transmission form of information. Every pixel is computable and transformable, meaning images and sounds can be modified as desired. Thus, the documentary and/or truth content of the image is lost due to the possibilities of digital manipulation, rendering it necessary to reformulate the questions regarding the authenticity and referentiality of digital images. The decisive break with the western cultural models characterized by the sequentiality and originality (or non-reproducibility) of the work of art can be regarded as inherent to the technological process, and here to digitization in particular.</p>
<p>The placing in question of originality inherent to this process leads to a change in the notion of author and authorship. The formation of the myth of the original was closely linked with the usage of terms likeintellectual property, genius, individuality or uniqueness in relation to artistic creation. In consequence of, among other things, Kant and his confirmation of the direct relationship between originality and genius, the ‹superstition› of the century—as Nietzsche described the ‹superstition of genius›—was adopted by an aesthetic discourse that has remained partially intact up to the present day. From the new focus on digital creation one becomes aware that the issue of originality makes use of utopian concepts in order to avoid a formulation of the problem. Such notions made themselves noticed throughout the twentieth century, as for instance in Walter Benjamin’s often cited auratic theory, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup> in which he uses the term ‹aura› as an aesthetic metaphor in order to support his thesis of the process of artistic decline in the age of mechanical reproduction. The loss of the aura due to the process of socialization thus means the end of an elitist aesthetics, leading—as Benjamin put it—to the liquidation of the traditional value of cultural heritage. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup> The lament about the loss of the aura is equivalent to the lament about the loss of the mythical-Romantic value of authenticity in connection with the individual (manual, direct and genius-inspired) creation, an attitude strongly rooted in bourgeois-intellectual tradition.</p>
<p>If one considers Benjamin’s argument that the mechanical reproduction of a work is responsible for the ‹decline› of the aura, one recognizes the contradiction in his hypothesis. The ‹aura› is a category of perception, and can therefore only arise during the process of reception; it is not inherent to the originality or authenticity or uniqueness of the work’s creation, i.e. it is not bound to the material or the object, but is observer-dependent. Within the process of reception the uniqueness or multifariousness of the object is a practical question in relation to accessing the work of art. And Benjamin’s critique concerns precisely this access. Asserting that mass reproduction is conducive to the reproduction of masses, <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup> he points to two-fold consequences: the erosion of the myth of the intellectual ‹exclusivity› of art, and the fear of cultural products being exploited by authoritarian regimes as a means of controlling the masses.</p>
<p>The objections to thinking in terms of originality become even more explicit with the introduction of new technologies to simulate the process of creation, paradigmatically exemplified by the AI program «Aaron,» with which the British artist Harold Cohen delivered a practical argument pointing out a different problem in connection with authorship and authenticity. His art-expert program is specialized in producing works with a ‹style› of their own. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup> By asking «Can machines think?»—a polemical question which practically launched the philosophy of Artificial Intelligence—Alan Turing attempted to investigate the relationship between simulation and real action. In addition, he opened the discussion about the possibility of working out a theoretical experiment that could serve as a criterion for deciding whether a computer is capable of thinking or not (the Turing Theorem). Since then the interest of researchers into Artificial Intelligence might be said, put briefly, to have centered on the question of the simulacrum. The issue divides into two fundamental themes: simulation as a phenomenon whose attributes merely approximate those of what is being simulated—in which case the term ‹pseudosimulation› would be applicable—and simulation as an exact copy of what is being simulated, with the only difference being the fact of the artificial production. The starting point for examinations in the field of AI is the question whether the technical reproduction of human thinking can be a simulation, and thus more than a pseudo-simulation. In the case of «Aaron» the question would accordingly be whether the program could be regarded as a simulacrum of the artist, just as Cohen could be regarded as the author of the works. If the question were answered in the affirmative, the next question would be: Can a computer simulate creative capability in the sense of aesthetics? From the 1960s onward this was a central point of discussion among computer artists and theorists (Frieder Nake, Abraham A. Moles, and others). Even if from the historical perspective the debate is not current, it is at present receiving new impetus from the growing possibilities of the AI systems as well as from their ever-more frequent employment in works of media art.</p>
<p>In recent years the AI specialist Margaret A. Boden has examined the relationship between informaticsand creativity, and also addressed the question of the extent to which a computer program might be able to generate creative ideas. One must begin, she says, by clarifying the meaning of the term creativity, which in her view consists in the ability of people to produce creative—that is, new, surprising and significant—ideas. AI systems such as «Aaron» can easily fulfil the parameters ‹new› and ‹surprising,› since the program’s activities are based on aesthetic parameters and random, unexpected transformations. The question of whether such systems comply with the criterion of significance is more difficult, she states, due to the dilemma that ideas can be described as meaningful or meaningless for any number of reasons in either case, and these reasons are dependent on place and time. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup> The question, therefore, would be whether a computer itself could recognize the value of its production. Two formulations of the problem are conceivable for Boden: one could deliberate whether evaluation criteria (deemed to be adequate) could be built into a program, which would then automatically apply these criteria to its own new ideas; or one could deliberate whether a program could itself be capable of authentically and independently assessing the value of a production. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup></p>
<p>There exist, as we know, artistic computer programs which possess specific evaluation criteria, and can even develop new values in dependence on the success of the works they produce (as for instance in systems of artificial life or in programs equipped with heuristic methods of altering conceptual areas or capable even of changing their own heuristics). Thus, analysis would be concentrated on intentionality and awareness, i.e. on the question whether computers can really know what they are doing when they evaluate their output. There is no doubt that the program «Aaron» neither is able to think about production quality, nor possesses any real or virtual causal relationship to the external world. However, just as programs are able to apply heuristic, specialized, or general methods and examine and modify their own processing modes, it would not be outlandish to assume that a program of this kind would be capable of producing art.</p>
<p>It is not yet possible to answer all these questions unequivocally, and many other questions have still tobe clearly formulated in the first place. The interest of the debate, however, lies in the placing in question of terms like artist, authorship, originality, work of art, creativity and awareness in relation to the value of creation and its artistic significance, and no less so in the critical examination of cognitive processes which are factors in artistic creation and realization.</p>
<h2 id="author-and-recipient"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#author-and-recipient"></a> Author and recipient</h2>
<p>Postmodern thought queries the sense of the notions of author and recipient, yet the interest granted to this subject is neither as contemporary nor as postmodern as its form of presentation usually suggests. The ‹death of the author› announced by the youngest heirs of Hegelian thought may be polemical, but their approach can be understood only if considered in the wider context of twentieth-century research into the function of author and recipient. Especially important in this connection is the Russian literary theorist and philosopher of language Mikhail M. Bakhtin (1895–1975) who, ignored until the 1970s, is now considered to be one of the representative theorists of literature. A keen critic of Formalism, he argues that the author and recipient of a work are equally important, and advocates a much broader conception of the aesthetic dimension which, deeming it to be a dialogical practice, he places within the overall context of cultural, philosophical and historical practice. His only partially surviving essay on the problem of the author was written probably in the first half of the 1920s, but first published in 1975 in Russian. However, the fragments that are available throw some light on his basic ideas, and although his deliberations refer to literature they can be applied to other areas of art. Bakhtin initially questions the significance usually conceded to the ‹material› with which the author works, namely language. He puts it that a writer does not create within the world of language, but merely makes use of language. In regard to the means, the artistic work determined by a writer’s main concern might be described as a transgression of the material. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> This approach bears some resemblance to two other previously described positions that break with tradition: first, the critical view of the central importance of object and material in aesthetic discourse; second, information theory and its excessiveinterest in the sign.</p>
<p>According to Bakhtin it is necessary to understand not the technical apparatus of creation, but its immanent logic; the context in which the creative act is carried out must always be taken into consideration. In other words, Bakhtin says that the predominance awarded to material and/or form reduces artistic work to a secondary and determined stage.</p>
<p>After the ‹transgression of the material› it is equally necessary to redefine the role of author and recipient. Bakhtin introduces the question of the ‹crisis of authorship›, and argues that it is not to be viewed exclusively in connection with the individual and his creative area, but implies a redefinition of the actual ‹place› of art within culture. The objective of the artist should have been not to surpass other artists but art itself. As Bakhtin sees it, this crisis is related to the rejection of cultural determinism; and in this manner a bridge could be set up between his thinking and the idea of ‹art beyond art.›The author is viewed as a component inherent to the work of art, a component reflected in the audience’s process of reception. With the work coming into being as the point of departure, the recipient must consequently be seen primarily as a contributor.</p>
<p>In his writings of 1970–1971 Bakhtin more explicitly examines the idea of the active recipient who has a share in the work coming about. Following Bakhtin, the process of reading and recording a work cannot be understood as a simple translation of another’s language into one’s own language, since the reader’s understanding consists in his ability to complete the work. The activity by which the understanding recipient approaches the work is thus active and creative, with its starting point being the recipient’s own viewpoint, world-view and personal attitudes. According to Bakhtin, therefore, the act of reading becomes one of ‹creative collaboration.› Once again, Bakhtin’s anticipation of later theories is remarkable: seeing the recipient not only as a participant in the creative act, he evaluates the procedure itself as ‹interaction.› Art, in his view, reveals itself to the recipient by means of an interactive process that takes on shape during the co-creative process of the reception of a work.</p>
<p>Iván Marino’s streaming-video-based online work« »In Death’s Dream Kingdom» (2003) deals with several points of this theory. The author creates an audiovisual hypertext that develops through a complex plot of videographic elements. The work establishes a dichotomy, addressed in the content of the videos, between the narrative construction on the user’s part and the deconstruction of language and perception. The attempt to impose order on the chaos does not create a new narrative but instead brings about navigation accidents of a kind which allow the user to link new forms of the contents. For instance, Marino structures the audiovisual information on various levels, and makes all the users active in the network visible over the interface. Most theories concerned with the concepts of author and recipient are based on two, shared, assumptions: first, the assumed central importance of the discourse about the defined object; second, the assumption that the object is a carrier of meaning or, as applicable, that the recipient can concede to it a specific meaning. Both of these basic assumptions are placed in question by new interpretations which have come about specifically in the interactive and telematic areas in the course of the development of media art.</p>
<h2 id="meta-author-and-interactor"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#meta-author-and-interactor"></a> Meta-author and interactor</h2>
<p>Participative works of art do not grant the viewer access to the creative experience solely over the cognitive path—as reception aesthetics suggests— but explicitly via action, too. Cybernetic art proposes that the viewer’s ‹passive› attitude toward the work be redefined on the basis of bi-directional communication theories. Participative art primarily endeavors to open up the work to the intervention of the viewer. Interactive digital systems are still more radical in this regard: in these complex, open and pluri-dimensional systems the recipient, here termed ‹interactor,› <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup> is not only mentally active within the realm of the work of art, but also takes on a fundamental and practical role in activating the work. The process of integrating the viewer and the peculiarities of the interactive digital system lead to new questions in regard to aesthetic paradigms, and also encourage a theoretical examination of the relationship between creation and reception as well as of the function of the recipient and the significance of the author.</p>
<p>The radical expansion of the conceptual framework demanded by media art implies that the form of perception triggered by the products of this kind of art will undergo significant alterations likewise. The North American artist Myron Krueger, a forerunner of interactive art, began his work in the field with the intention of examining those changes which interactive systems could bring about in viewer perception. Krueger’s interest focused on investigating the relationship between human and computer—a phenomenon which is, in his view, among the most significant for the contemporary world. After studying computer science, he discovered that research into the possibilities of the human-machine interface must be based on methods which are aesthetic rather than strictly technical or scientific.</p>
<p>His first reactive environment «Glowflow» (developed in 1969 together with a group of artists and engineers) offered visitors the possibility of modifying visual and sound parameters by means of pressure-sensitive sensors. Due to the crowds of visitors in the exhibition space the system was permanently activated, meaning that nobody noticed that the presence of the individual was what triggered its reactions. This flaw brought it home to Krueger that the objective, strictly speaking, is not to create interactive art, but to give the interactive computer system an artistic form accessible and comprehensible to the audience. It is therefore necessary to subordinate traditional, purely aesthetic, interests to the creation of an interactive relationship between work and interactor. At the same time this requires a redefinition of the three fundamental areas: perception, mode of presentation, and structure.</p>
<p>A confrontation with perception is fundamental in the case of such a reactive installation, since the work must react to human behavior and therefore correctly ‹interpret› what the interactor does; it is also important that the audience, in order to be able to properly accept a work’s invitation to dialogue, becomes aware of the work’s reactive possibilities. Thus, a new dimension is added to the system and the recipient: the computer technology deployed in the work must record, ‹perceive,› process and appropriately reciprocate the messages communicated by the audience. The viewer enters into directcontact with the work of art and modifies it with his actions. Decisive is the fact that it is a matter of direct, often intuitive and functional, intervention—in contrast to the intellectual dimension of the aforementioned ‹model› or ‹implicit› recipient. A flexible work enabling the audience to be integrated needs to possess an open structure that permits this access. This makes it necessary to move away from the defined and completed structural model of the ‹traditional› work of art. Interactive art breaks with the stable, object-like system brought to conclusion by the artist (see Margarita Schultz, »Instabilität, eine Ästhetik der digitalen Produktionen«), a system that predominates in western culture and its forms of artistic expression. It is ultimately a matter of creating a channel for the exchange of information among work of art, viewer, and context. This channel must be able to build up a dialogic network that is open enough to enable communication, and not just the circulation of data.</p>
<p>The example of the nexus between Harald Cohen and «Aaron» illustrates this complex situation of the creator of a work in connection with technological production processes which in turn directly or indirectly influence the mode in which the work is received. The question of ‹who› is the author of the work leads inevitably to an expanded notion of the author. Various theoreticians , among them Douglas Hofstadter, speak of a ‹meta-author› as the author of the author of the result. In Cohen’s case the program «Aaron» is the author of the result; the program can therefore be described as the author of the generated works, and Cohen, who created «Aaron,» as the meta-author. According to Hofstadter, the human being deserves credit for having invented the program, but not for having brought forth those ideas developed by the program. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup></p>
<p>A similar development is discernible likewise in interactive works in which the active participation of the interactor is a constitutive element in the actual process of generating the work. In such a case the interactor could become a ‹co-author› (depending on the specific degree of participation permitted or offered by the work), while the artist would be transformed into a ‹meta-author.› It would be erroneous, however, to interpret these categorieshierarchically or to attach to them different degrees of significance; it is important to view them as complementary components of the work.</p>
<p>The examples and considerations discussed above lead to a fundamental finding: contemporary art based on digital media and tools not only constantly questions its own status, but also queries the role of the artist, the position of the recipient in regard to the work of art, the function of the work, the function of the machine, and—very importantly—the relationship obtaining among artist, work, and recipient. The frequency with which these questions arise, along with the diversity of perspectives possible and angles adopted, makes clear the futility of attempts—such as those by exponents of information or cybernetic aesthetics—to draw up universal definitions and/or rigid and homogeneous models for the ‹entirety› of contemporary art production, because the art triggers the continuous renewal and reformulation of these concepts and relationships.</p>

<li>The idea of a scientific analysis of organization systems was first formulated in the early twentieth century by the Russian researcher Alexander Bogdanov. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> His system theory, which attempts to register all organization elements in their entirety, introduced the basic concepts of the open system (with reference to living systems) and of feedback, and made Bogdanov a forerunner of cybernetics and of the systemic theories Ludwig von Bertalanffy would develop two decades later. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></li>

<p>俄罗斯研究员Alexander Bogdanov（亚历山大·波格丹诺夫）在二十世纪初首先提出了对组织体系进行科学分析的构想。 [1]他的系统理论试图全部提出所有系统性的元素，介绍了开放系统（参考生命系统）和反馈的基本概念，并且使Bogdanov（博格丹诺夫）先导的控制论和Ludwig von Bertalanffy（路德维希冯贝塔朗菲）先导的系统理论在二十年后有所发展。</p>

<li>The first comprehensive contribution to the understanding and dissemination of the theory of self-organization was the result of the research carried out by the physicist and cyberneticist Heinz von Foerster from the late 1950s on, and especially after the publication of his treatise «On Self- Organizing Systems and their Environment» of 1960. Heinz von Foerster was well acquainted with cybernetics and information theory, and likewise with the basics of Artificial Intelligence (A. Turing and J. von Neumann) and system theory (P. Weiss and L. von Bertalanffy). Taking these theories as his starting point, heproposed that concepts such as those of redundancy, entropy or information (cybernetics) as well as those of self-regulation, autonomy and hierarchic order (system theory) be applied in the examination of organization. As Foerster saw it, every system exists autonomously—according to its own laws—and is organizationally self-contained, meaning its organization is selfreferential, self-maintaining, and recursive. He understood reality to be an interactive construction in which the observer and what is observed are two interdependent sub-aspects. In consequence, objectivity exists merely as an illusion on the part of the subject, even without whom a perception could exist independently. This implies that perception takes place by means of a linkage of observer and system unit, and namely in the domain in which this unit operates. In the 1970s and 1980s the basic concepts of system research, which relate to interaction, self-organization, co-evolution, or the environment, were further developed by a number of scientists, and translated into new theories. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> System theory received an important impetus from the theory of «autopoiesis» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> developed from the 1970s onward by the Chilean biologist Humberto together with the neuroscientist Francisco J. Varela. This theory linked for the first time two areas until then studied only separately: biology, or the theory of the organization of living organisms, and cognitive theory, which is particularly concerned with the problem of the cognition and perception of phenomena. In 1969 Maturana drew up the thesis according to which the nervous system is a closed system. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup></li>

Turing和J. von Neumann）和系统论（P. Weiss和L. von Bertalanffy）的基础知识。 以这些理论为出发点，他提出冗余，熵或信息（控制论）以及自我调节，自治和等级秩序（系统论）等概念应用于系统性的考察。正如Foerster所看到的那样，每个系统都是根据自己的规律自治地存在的，并且在组织上是独立的，意味着它的组织是自我指涉的，自我维护的和递归的。 他将现实理解为一种交互式的构造，其中观察者和所观察到的是两个相互依赖的子方面（sub-aspects）。 结果，客观存在仅仅是作为主体方面的幻想，即使人的感觉是没有办法独立存在的。 这意味着感知通过观察者和系统单元的联系发生，即在该单元运作的领域之间发生。在20世纪70年代和80年代，与相互作用，自组织，共同进化或环境相关的系统研究的基本概念，由许多科学家进一步发展，并转化为新的理论。 [3]系统理论受到了智利生物学家Humberto（温贝托）与神经科学家Francisco J. Varela（弗朗西斯科瓦雷拉）一起从20世纪70年代发展起来的“autopoiesis”（“自创生成”）理论的重要推动。 这个理论第一次把两个领域联系起来，直到那时才分别研究：生物学或生物组织理论，认知理论，特别关注现象的认知和感知问题。 1969年，马图拉纳撰写了一篇论文，论述了神经系统是一个封闭的系统。[5]</p>

<p>According to this thesis, living systems are autopoietic. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> An autopoietic system operates as a closed system that generates only states of autopoiesis. The most important consequence of an autopoietic organization consists in the fact that everything occurring within the system is subjected to autopoiesis; otherwise the living system would collapse, because changes in the state of the organism and of the nervous system as well as of the medium act reciprocally, and so give rise to continuous autopoiesis. That means that living systems are determined by their structure («structure-specified»), and that autopoiesis represents their constitutive attribute. The expansion of the cognitive processes(action and interaction) by the nervous system enables, according to Maturana, non-physical interactions between organisms in simple relationships—and therefore communication. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup><br>
根据这篇论文，生命系统是自生的。 [^ 6]一个自创生系统作为一个只产生自动生成状态的封闭系统运行。 一个自创生组织的最重要的后果在于，系统内发生的所有事情都会受到自动生成的影响; 否则生命系统就会崩溃，因为生物体和神经系统以及媒体状态的变化会相互作用，从而导致不断的自我创生。 这意味着生命系统是由它们的结构决定的（“结构指定”），并且自生成代表了它们的构成属性。 根据Maturana的观点，神经系统的认知过程（行为和相互作用）的扩展使得简单关系中的生物体之间的非物理相互作用成为可能，从而促进了沟通。<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7:1">[7:1]</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These non-physical interactions distinguish human beings from organisms that lack a nervous system and in which interactions are purely physical in nature (as in the case of a plant, for example, where the reception of a photon triggers photosynthesis). Communication as interaction is a component of the system, and as a cognitive process does not refer to an autonomous external reality, but is—according to Maturana—a process of behavioral coordination between the observers through structural coupling. In this way, the cognitive domain is characterized by consensual coordinations of actions that enable operations to take place in many different cognitive domains constituting different realization modes of autopoiesis. [^8]<br>
这些非物理的相互作用将人类与缺乏神经系统的生物区分开来，并且其中相互作用纯粹是物理性质的（例如植物的情况下，例如，接收光子触发光合作用）。 交流作为交互作用是系统的一个组成部分，而认知过程并不是指自主的外部现实，而是 - 根据Maturana - 通过结构耦合观察者之间的行为协调过程。 通过这种方式，认知领域的特点是协调一致的行为，使行动能够发生在构成自创生的不同实现模式的许多不同认知领域中。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one speaks of a ‹world› or of ‹our culture,› then one would seem to be referring to something external, something independent of humanity, or to ‹an› objective reality. Contradicting this view, Constructivist theory holds that an organism creates its world on the basis of its physiological and functional constitution. As Maturana surmises: we create the world by perceiving it.<br>
如果一个人谈到一个&lt;世界&gt;或&lt;我们的文化&gt;，那么人们似乎指的是某种外在的，独立于人类的东西，或者是客观的现实。 与建构主义理论相反的是，建构主义理论认为，有机体以其生理和功能结构为基础创造了它的世界。 正如Maturana所猜测的那样：我们通过感知创造世界。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accordingly, three basic conclusions can be formulated from the systemtheoretic perspective. First, it is not permissible to allocate the cognitive phenomena, including language and communication, to any connotative or denotative function of reality which is independent of the observer; second, that which is produced by cultures is the result of interactions between living systems, as well as between living systems and their specific environment (or «niche,» as Maturana calls it); and, third, neither cultures nor the results, such as art, of creative operations emerge as ‹independent› attributes or objective and autonomous realities, but are always dependent on the observer, i.e. on the cognitive system. Therefore they are attributes of the consensual domain in which living systems operate. Only over context- and observer-dependency is it even possible to explain to human perception and cognition the operationality of cognition. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> If this finding is transferred to art, then one could join Werner Heisenberg in saying that whatone views is not the work itself, but the work while being exposed to a particular mode of observation.<br>
因此，从系统理论的角度出发可以得出三个基本结论。首先，不允许将包括语言和交流在内的认知现象分配给与观察者无关的任何内隐或外延的现实功能;其次，由文化产生的东西是生命系统之间以及生命系统与其特定环境之间相互作用的结果（或Maturana称之为“niche”）;第三，创造性操作的文化和结果（如艺术）既不是独立的，也不是客观的，自主的现实，而是始终依赖于观察者，即认知系统。因此它们是生命系统运行的共识领域的属性。只有在情境和观察者依赖的情况下，才有可能向人类认知和认知解释认知的操作性。如果这一发现转移到艺术上，那么人们可以加入维尔纳海森堡的观点，即任何人的观点不是作品本身，而是作品在接触某种特定的观察模式时。</p>

<p>Ken Rinaldo’s A-life installation «Autopoiesis» (2000) is an example of the application of organization parameters to interactive art. It assigns an important role to the environment and to the observers, since both intervene in the individual or collective behavior of the robots, as if the latter were biological beings. Rinaldo creates two organizational levels in the interactive installation: an internal process of organization generated by the communicative reciprocal relationship among the robots and independent of the environment; and a system of organization that is based on the intelligent sensors employed and heightens the data-processing capacity by registering the presence of foreign elements and immediately generating feedback. Thus, by means of the technological simulation of artificial life, his work experiments with ‹organic› autopoietic mechanisms, and underscores the interdependence of the machines, the function of the viewer, and the close relationship to the environment.<br>
Ken Rinaldo的A-life装置«Autopoiesis»（2000）是组织参数应用于互动艺术的一个例子。它赋予环境和观察者一个重要的角色，因为它们都介入机器人的个人或集体行为，就好像后者是生物一样。里纳尔多在交互式安装中创建了两个组织级别：一个由机器人之间的交互性相互关系产生的独立于环境的组织内部过程;以及基于所使用的智能传感器的组织系统，并通过注册外来元素的存在并立即生成反馈来提高数据处理能力。因此，通过对人造生命的技术模拟，他的作品尝试了&lt;有机&gt;自动生成机制，并强调了机器的相互依赖性，观众的功能以及与环境的密切关系。</p>

<li>Maturana and Varela’s model of autopoeisis roused controversy at the same time as they stimulated new approaches to problems of cognitive research. Together with the contributions of Heinz von Foerster and, in the area of cognitive psychology, of Ernst von Glasersfeld, the model delivered impulses for a new current known as Constructivism or Radical Constructivism. This mode of thought is decisive insofar as it negates any possibility of being able to understand systems by means of analytic and reductionist methods, since it acknowledges the principle of self-organization to be fundamental. Man is part of a world of his own construction, and his life depends on the interactions formed by this interlocking system, or network.<br>
This model, however, aims to avoid tendencies toward an orthodox Constructivist attitude. The risk of research concentrating on internal and autopoietic processes of neuronal organization consists largely in the fact that their model conception refers to a closed apparatus with no knowledge of the external. The brain can be viewed as an operational, self-referential system in the sense of a purely internal function; in the cognitive system, however, interior and exterior (environment) are interrelated. Theacquisition of knowledge, education and culture is dependent on individual experiences of life.<br>
Maturana和Varela的autopoeisis模型在激发对认知研究问题的新方法的同时激起了争议。加上Heinz von Foerster的贡献，以及在认知心理学方面，Ernst von Glasersfeld的贡献，该模型推动了一种称为建构主义或激进建构主义的新潮流。这种思维方式是决定性的，因为它承认自组织的基本原则是否能通过分析和还原方法来理解系统。人是他自己建构的世界的一部分，他的生活取决于这个互相连锁的系统或网络所形成的相互作用。<br>
然而，这种模式旨在避免正统建构主义态度的倾向。研究集中于神经组织内部和自创生过程的研究风险很大程度上取决于这样一个事实，即他们的模型概念指的是一种不知道外部因素的封闭设备。大脑可以被看作纯粹内在功能意义上的可操作的自我指涉系统;然而，在认知系统中，内部和外部（环境）是相互关联的。获取知识，教育和文化取决于个人的生活经验。</li>
<li>Selfreferentiality does not mean isolation, since the systems can be influenced from outside, even if the manner of this influence is determined by their functional organization. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> Essential to the perception and construction of reality are other processes that produce a model of one’s own body (of the ego), and a spatiotemporal model as well as a model of the place in the time-space. The importance for brain activity of the limbic system—of the emotional and intentional components—makes it clear that the understanding and interpreting of reality are not exclusively the results of neuronal processes.<br>
自我认同并不意味着孤立，因为即使这种影响的方式是由其功能组织决定的，系统也可能受到外界的影响。 [^ 10]对现实的感知和建构的基本要素是产生自己的身体模型（自我的模型），以及时空模型和时空位置模型(Essential to the perception and construction of reality are other processes that produce a model of one’s own body (of the ego), and a spatiotemporal model as well as a model of the place in the time-space. )。 边缘系统的大脑活动的重要性 - 情感和意图的组成部分 - 明确地表明，对现实的理解和解释不完全是神经过程的结果。</li>
<li>That which is experienced as reality is socially conditioned, for its construction rests on interaction with other individuals, on consensual domains, on language and culture. In summary it can be said that knowledge is a creative process that depends both on cognition and on interpersonal relationships and interactions with the environment: thus the entirety of knowledge, culture and art is based on the consensus, interactions and networking of individuals constituting society.<br>
那些被认为是现实的东西是社会条件性的，因为它的构建依赖于与其他个人之间的互动，基于共识的领域，语言和文化。 总之，可以说知识是一个创造性的过程，既依赖于认知，也依赖于人际关系和与环境的相互作用：因此，知识，文化和艺术的整体基于构成社会的个人的共识，互动和网络。</li>

<ol start="11">
<li>Albert Einstein once stated that scientific theories are free creations of the human mind, and that he considered it to be the most wonderful thing to be able to use them, nevertheless, to explain the world. The same might be said of art. As a free creation of the human mind, it does not explain an independent world; rather, it takes issue with the experience of the subject in his world, and offers various explanatory models for a context in which the observer and the work partake.<br>
阿尔伯特爱因斯坦曾经说过，科学理论是人类思想的自由创造，并且他认为能够使用它们是最奇妙的事情，但是它可以解释世界。 艺术也是如此。 作为人类思想的自由创造，它不能解释一个独立的世界; 相反，它在他的世界中对主体的经验提出了问题，并为观察者和工作参与者的情境提供了各种解释模型。</li>
<li>Vilém Flusser’s thesis states that the function of art is to create other worlds and to enable access to other realities. Anyone who produces a work of art not only expresses with it a part of himself and his environment, but also brings about a dialogue with other observers and a projection of other realities. Because art commits itself to this process, changing the world—expanding human realities (knowledge, experiences, sensations or perceptions)— becomes its cause.</li>
<li>From this perspective, every reality is based on experiences and actions of the creator as well as of the viewer, and is thus one argument in a (possible) explanation. As an operation within a consensual domain, the dialogic process can expand this domain and contribute to the emergence of new consensual domains, leading to an expansion of experiences, knowledge and arguments, which can potentially result in an altered cognitive horizon. Accordingly, as a form of communication, art must be ascribed to the domain of cognition that creates the prerequisites of communication. «Thought, science and art are selfreferential cognitive processes, but they are not self-maintaining: they need the physical-chemical existence of organisms that bring forth cognition, and with it thought, science and art. Whereas autopoietic systems can invariably carry out self-maintenance only in the physical-chemical framework preordained by their environment, cognitive processes are free from these restrictions and obey only internal laws and exigencies.» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup></li>
<li>In the art domain, therefore, reference to knowledge does not mean an approach to its possible contents exclusively on the basis of reason; rather, the intention is to emphasize that the co-influence of emotions and sensory experiences in the process of assimilating a work of art is an inseparable part of the dialogic process.</li>
<li>In summary, two hypotheses can be set up. One is that since explanations of art are not constitutive, reductionist or transcendental, it is by no means a matter of the search for a single and definitive explanation for the domain of art. The other is that the function of art consists in changing the world, with the latter being understood to mean the expansions of human realities and cognitive domains, and consequently also of the knowledge and experiences resulting from possible interactions and the dialogic exchange in the explanatory context of the cognitive worlds. This leads to the question of how art can execute the communicative process.</li>
<li>The branch of aesthetics more closely modeled on communication science examines social processes that develop expressive forms as well as phenomena of aesthetic expression fulfilling communicative functions (communication media, events, or social ceremonies).In art it is possible to distinguish among various modes of proceeding by which the problematic of communication is tackled: through the role of the viewer in the context of the work, through the analysis of the reception, or—as proposed for instance by Fred Forest and the proponents of ‹communication aesthetics›—from sociological viewpoints concerned with the influence of art on viewer, society or culture.</li>
<li>Art is an especially complex socio-cultural domain because in the process of communication it avails itself of a mainly metaphoric, symbolic and non-trivial language. If there are several domains of reality, and all of them are equally valid, the theories of art aesthetics cannot individually lay claim to universal acceptance; nor can they be viewed as inherent to the object. Sense and meaning do not lie in the work of art itself, and cannot be conveyed through the latter in the expectation that the work will be adequately interpreted. In art, meanings are time-bound, culture-specific, observer-dependent cognitive processes; therefore, works of art cannot speak for themselves.</li>
<li>A work of art should indeed invite the observer to enter its domain of reality and take an interest in its view of the world. If one viewer, or a group of viewers, is led to new consensual domains by a work of art, and hence to new cognition, then not only the creative act has been accomplished successfully, but communication has been, too: the spreading of a world-view to a community. Although art-works and communication are separate domains, neither works of art nor systems of art can exist without communication, no more so than art-communication is possible without art; accordingly, art-works serve the coupling of cognition and communication. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> This amounts to a new theoretical position that deviates from the cybernetic model.</li>
<li>Communication is no longer understood to mean the transmission of information, and nor is it seen as the transmission of knowledge from one system to another. It replaces the information-technical principle of communication with the model of the construction process within the cognitive systems and between systems. [^13] This process-oriented perspective is observer-dependent, i.e. as part of a network of social systems, every observer or observer community co-constitutessystems, and these naturally include art systems among others. Orientation has shifted from information objectivity to intersubjective interactivity.</li>
<li>One consequence is that art is becoming a kind of «catalyst of society’s cultural reflection.» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> Proposals representing a threat to the existence of a consensus-based cognitive domain can meet with strong emotional rejection within the cultural community. By contrast, twentieth-century art offers countless examples of cases in which with the aid of intentional polemics cognition domains were expanded through the institution of ‹art› being forced to criticize itself.</li>
<li>The meaning of art and its aesthetics is to be sought in the function it exercises within the given observer communities, as well as in its ability to bring about by means of a language of its own an emotional and conceptual dialogue with the observer and the community.</li>

<h3 id="interactivity-the-interface-question"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#interactivity-the-interface-question"></a> Interactivity: the interface question</h3>
<p>Just as people need the media for communication, technical interfaces enable different systems to be linked. It is a matter thereby of reducing spatio-temporal distances and of optimizing the response time and flexibility of the connection. The resultant re-definition of the positions adopted by both systems—subject and machine—influences the communication process. On the one hand, the subject is no longer merely an operator controlling a tool; on the other hand, the machine undergoes constant growth in regard to the independence of its functioning—in other words, it is no longer a ‹simple› tool in the traditional sense.<br>
21. This gradual assimilation of the position and weighting in the humanmachine communication process <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> is clearly evident in the «Interface Model» of William Bricken. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup> With it he attempts to minimize the distance between the systems (A) and (B) and at the same time to demonstrate the reciprocal influence exercised on the agents by the interaction processes. This means that every transmission of information influences and defines the linked systems. In «Interface Model 4» Bricken introduces a further factor: the context. According to Bricken the interface boundaryrepresents the knowledge of the interaction environment on the part of the interacting agents. On being introduced into the interaction process, the parameter of context becomes an influencing factor in the communication process. Context is a component of the interaction between two systems in the measure which they share this parameter, but can be altered in the course of the process.</p>
<h3 id="context-and-environment"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#context-and-environment"></a> Context and environment</h3>
<ol start="23">
<li>The position of Niklas Luhmann must be recalled to mind in regard to the factors of context/environment. System theory abandoned the idea of a totality constituted of parts in order to introduce the explicit reference to the environment. Luhmann goes one step further by making the structures and processes of a system dependent on their relationships to a specific environment, indicating that these structures and processes are comprehensible only in relation to this environment. This mutual dependence declares that one cannot design or create an interactive system in isolated form, since as a completed element it would a posteriori adapt to a random environment. «Systems of interaction are formed when the presence of people is used to solve through communication the problem of dual contingency. Presence brings with it perceptibility, and insofar structural coupling to communicatively not controllable consciousness processes.» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup><br>
Communication, in Luhmann’s view, is in real life an environmentadapted operation. This adaptation, however, is not completely controllable in terms of cognition or, put differently, no communication is capable of checking every single step of the process.</li>
<li>Alongside context/environment, time is another significant point of reference both from the perspective of optimizing interaction and recursivity as well as in regard to the response times between two systems. The endeavor to optimize the human-machine interaction process and the response times involved led to an enhancement of the visualization and sensorial perception of computer-processed information.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="translation"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#translation"></a> Translation</h3>
<ol start="25">
<li>A further, crucial question is aimed directly at the notion of translation. Abraham A. Moles had already addressed the subject of ‹translation› <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup> as one of the main factors in the human-machine relationship. From the technical viewpoint the interface assumes the function of translating and conveying information between two interconnected systems. As Halbach emphasizes, the problem lies precisely in the notion of ‹translation,› because not only does it connect various input and output channels, it also regulates and communicates various coding methods. «When it is a matter of interfaces of human-machine interaction, then (a) input and output channels cannot be adjusted to each other, since they are precisely what a human being, as an autopoietic system, does not possess, and (b) is it not possible to speak of a translation of the coding method, since the subsymbolic representation forms of the human nervous have not (yet) been decrypted.» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup><br>
Due to the employment of technical media, interaction based on a human-machine interface denotes a qualitative expansion of communication computer displays and interfaces function as control mechanisms that maintain the equivalence of communication. For this reason, control—conscious or unconscious—is among the most relevant research tasks in the area of interactive systems.</li>
<li>Today’s systems convey to the user impressions or sensations that are only partially attributable to his own sensory or motor activities, since the possibilities of interaction and the generation of outputs (for instance, moving three-dimensional images, or sound) are determined by the particular program constituting the user’s field of action. In the measure to which the user cannot completely control the cognitive processes of interactive communication in the simulated environment, part of the control must necessarily be exercised by the system itself.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="models-of-interactive-systems"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#models-of-interactive-systems"></a> Models of interactive systems</h3>
<ol start="27">
<li>The actions of the observer thus exercise a fundamental and complementary function in interactive systems. The resultant need for synchronous humanmachine reactions, and the interdependence between the context of the subject and that of the systemenvironment, lead to the question of the different typologies of interactive systems and their strategies.</li>
<li>Various works of media art deploying reactive systems and digital images at the same time directly or indirectly investigate the changes that the observer, by means of data manipulation over interfaces, can bring about in the work. Three models of interactive system can be roughly distinguished on the basis of media-assisted forms of interactivity: <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup><br>
— Discrete or active systems: although the user can control the content called up, and the sequence in which this occurs, he/she has no influence on the transmitted information, since the management of this information, which demonstrates predictable behavior, is integrated.<br>
— Reactive systems: the work’s behavior, which is media-assisted and based on feedback structures, results from the direct reaction to external stimuli, for instance user control or altered environmental conditions. Selection methods and recursive events create cognitive situations for the participative user.<br>
— Interactive systems: open program structuring, over which the receiver can also act as transmitter. Since the user can influence the procedure and appearance of the work, or even add new information in the case of more complex systems, it is a matter of content-related interactivity. Temporal, spatial, or content-based relations are established between interactor and work.</li>
<li>Heinz von Foerster makes a distinction between trivial and non-trivial machines in regard to technical specificity. Trivial machines are causally describable and predictable, and conceivable only in non-physical areas such as mathematics. Machines in physical space are always non-trivial, since this space is subject to entropic processes. Two types of non-trivial machines can be distinguished: those which attempt to adjust their behavior to the trivial machines, and those which behave non-trivially. The former are purposeoriented machines, the latter are ones which are potentially suitable for interactivity. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup></li>
<li>According to Peter Weibel three different models of interactivity can be drawn up from the viewpoints of behavior and consciousness: synaesthetic interactivity, which consists of interactivity between variousmaterials and elements, such as image and sound, color and music; synergetic interactivity, which takes place between states of energy, as in works that react to changes in their environment; and communicative or kinetic interactivity between different people and between persons and objects.<br>
In all cases, environment or context are of crucial importance to the human-machine performance. As stated already, the integration of context into the interactivity process means acknowledging it as a conditioning factor in the communication process. Peter Weibel reflects upon the relationship of dependence between observer and context in his interactive installation «Cartesian Chaos» of 1992.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="artsystem"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#artsystem"></a> Art/system</h3>
<ol start="31">
<li>Interactivity in art is therefore composed, as Peter Weibel proposes, of three digital characteristics: virtuality, variability, and viability.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup> On the other hand, the human-machine interface attests to the transformation of a culture based on narratively logocentric and sequential structures into a ‹digital culture› that is visual, sensory, retroactive and nonlinear (hypertextual) in orientation. The special potentiality of digital technology (including the telematic) is applied in order to overcome the boundaries of the purely instrumental and so accomplish the transformation into a medium of the imaginary generating cognitively and sensorially experiencable (virtual) environments.</li>
<li>On the basis of all these factors associated with media art in general and with interactive art in particular, a crucial shift in the meaning of ‹art› towards that of ‹system›<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> is clearly discernible (without wanting to simply replace one term with another).</li>
<li>The analysis of interactive systems leads to the conclusion that the interest lies no longer in the production of a work of art that reflects upon world- views through the reproduction or interpretation of ways of seeing, but that the work of art, as a ‹system,› attempts to scrutinize the world itself: the realities, the contexts, the life, the biological system of humanity. It is a system that opens up new ‹world-views.› Contemporary art creation assisted by processbased methods and systemic models is gainingnew significance in the sociocultural context, and thereby contradicting art’s postulated loss of function in the present-day world. Moreover, the idiosyncrasy of the process as well as the interactive and systemic character of the work produced inevitably entails a transformation of aesthetic paradigms.</li>
<li>The systemic practices based on the use of interactive technologies demand an aesthetic theory appropriate to their methods. Endo-physics, which is closely linked with Constructivism, hereby offers ideal foundations for concepts inspiring proposals for an «endo-aesthetics,»<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup>a theory considered to be suitable for recording the different manifestations of interactive and artificial systems.<br>

<li>
<p>Deliberations on the connection between art and science have various points of departure. The most general considerations are limited to the assumption of a parallel development. In his writings published in 1970, Werner Heisenberg, who along with Max Planck counts as a founding father of quantum theory, stated that the tendencies towards abstraction in the sciences were comparable with those in the field of art. According to Heisenberg, new artistic and scientific forms can result only from new content, but the converse does not apply. To renew art or to revolutionize science, he wrote, meant to create new content and concepts, and not just new forms. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup><br>
对艺术与科学之间关系的讨论有不同的出发点。 最普遍的考虑仅限于并行开发的假设。 在1970年出版的着作中，与马克斯·普朗克一起成为量子理论的创始人之一的维尔纳海森伯格指出，科学中抽象的倾向与艺术领域的倾向相当。 根据海森堡的说法，新的艺术和科学形式只能由新内容产生，但相反并不适用。 他写道，重建艺术或革命化科学意味着创造新的内容和概念，而不仅仅是新的形式。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A question more complex than that of parallels between art and science is the extent to which art influences the sciences. According to Peter Weibel, this question can be answered only methodologically, that is by applying a comparison which views art and science as methods. While science, says Weibel, is distinctly methodological in character, art is generally not regarded as a method: «This is our first claim: art and science can only reasonably be compared if weaccept that both are methods. This does not mean that we declare that both have the same methods. We only want to declare that both have a methodological approach, even if their methods are or can be different.» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup><br>
比艺术与科学之间的相似之处更复杂的问题是艺术对科学的影响程度。 根据Peter Weibel的说法，这个问题只能通过方法论来回答，即通过比较，将艺术和科学视为方法。 Weibel说，尽管Weibel在科学上具有明显的方法论性质，但艺术通常不被视为一种方法：“这是我们的第一个主张：如果我们认为两者都是方法，艺术和科学只能合理地进行比较。 这并不意味着我们宣称两者都有相同的方法。 我们只想表明两者都具有方法论的途径，即使他们的方法是或可能不同。”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accordingly it would be permissible to view art and science as convergent in the methodological sense. As Weibel sees it, science is influenced by art in regard to its methods, but not by its products and references: «Because any time science develops the tendency for its methods to become too authoritarian, too dogmatic, science turns to art and to the methodology of art which is plurality of methods.» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> The objective nature exists neither in the framework of the sciences nor in culture regardless of social construction, «art and science meet and converge in the method of social construction.» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup><br>
因此，可以将艺术和科学视为方法论意义上的趋同。 正如魏贝尔所看到的那样，科学受其艺术方法的影响，但不受其产品和参考文献的影响：“因为任何时候科学的发展趋势都会使其方法变得过于专制，过于教条化，科学就转向艺术，转向本身就多元的艺术方法。”[^ 3]客观本质既不存在于科学的框架中，也不存在于文化中，不论社会建构如何，“艺术与科学在社会建构的方法中相遇并融合”。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This position finds its most radical expression in the science-theoretical contributions of Paul Feyerabend. As a critic of scientific rationalism, he develops new interpretations and connections among the arts and sciences. He is of the opinion that artists and scientists developing a style or theory frequently pursue a secondary intention, namely that of representing ‹the› truth or ‹the› reality. However, artistic styles are closely connected with styles of thought.<br>
这一立场在Paul Feyerabend的科学理论贡献中找到了最激进的表达。 作为科学理性主义的批评家，他在艺术和科学之间发展了新的解释和联系。 他认为，发展一种风格或理论的艺术家和科学家经常追求第二个意图，即表现真理或现实。 然而，艺术风格与思想风格密切相关。<br>

<p>:::<br>
5. That which a specific form of thought understands concepts such as truth or reality to mean is what this form of thought asserts as truth. When one decides in favor of a style, a reality, or a form of truth, then one always chooses a human-made construction. In other words, Feyerabend negates the possibility of absolute rationality and logic in regard to that which is created by the human mind. He asserts that this relativist, and in a certain sense irrational, factor inherent in every branch of science places science in the proximity of art. According to Feyerabend, the sciences are not an institution of objective truth, but are arts along the lines of a progressive understanding of art. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup><br>
特定形式的思想理解真理或现实这些概念的含义是这种思想形式所说的真理。 当人们决定支持一种风格，一种现实或一种真理时，人们总会选择一种人造的建筑。 换句话说，费耶阿本德(Feyerabend)否定了关于人的思想所创造的绝对理性和逻辑的可能性。 他断言，这个相对主义者，以及某种意义上非理性因素，科学的每一个分支固有的因素都将科学置于艺术的附近。 根据费耶阿本德的说法，科学不是客观真理的制度，而是艺术逐渐理解的艺术。</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>Feyerabend’s line of argument reflects the skepticism that deeply influenced occidental culture and science well into the twentieth century. The aforementioned questions of truth, reality and reason are central components of the contest between rationalism and relativism affecting art no less directlythan science. If the nature of science were to be considered a research method under the premises of reality, plausibility, and dialectics, then whoever attempted to identify these three principles by strictly observing the complexity of the objects would, according to the Spanish scientist Jorge Wagensberg, reach the conclusion that the object resisted the method. The only manner of proceeding would be to «soften up» the method, with the result that «science is transformed into ideology.» «At its core ideology means not research, but faith. It follows from this consideration that one must stop with ideology all the holes which science has itself failed to stop. […] If the knowledge towards which we aspire is ruled not by laws but by world-views, then it would seem expedient to take our leave of scientific methods, and perhaps even adopt principles radically opposed to the latter. Precisely that is the case in art, in a kind of knowledge whose creators have not the least interest in distancing themselves from their creation.» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup><br>
费耶阿本德(Feyerabend)的论据反映了对西方文化和科学深深影响到二十世纪的怀疑论。上述关于真理，现实和理性的问题是理性主义和相对主义之间对艺术的争夺的核心组成部分，这些对艺术的影响不亚于科学。根据西班牙科学家Jorge Wagensberg的说法，如果科学的本质在现实，合理性和辩证法的前提下被认为是一种研究方法，那么无论谁试图通过严格观察这些物体的复杂性来确定这三个原则，该对象抵制该方法的结论。唯一的处理方式是“软化”方法，结果是“科学转化为意识形态”。“其核心思想意味着不是研究，而是信仰。&quot;从这一点出发，人们必须意识到科学自身未能阻止的所有漏洞…”如果我们所追求的知识不是由法律而是由世界观来统治的话，那么让我们放弃科学方法似乎是合适的，甚至可能采用与后者完全相反的原则。这恰恰就是艺术中的情况，一种知识的创造者并没有丝毫的兴趣来将自己从创作中解脱出来。“</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Of particular relevance to the understanding of a new interpenetration of art and science is the generative nature of either area, which brings forth words or world-views of its own. For that reason, «the worlds of art and science are ideologically no longer opposites,» as Ilya Prigogine states, «the variety of the significates and the basic opacity of the world are reflected in new languages and new formalisms.» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup><br>
与理解艺术与科学的新相互渗透特别相关的是任何一个领域的生成性质，它带来了自己的文字或世界观。 出于这个原因，“艺术和科学的世界在意识形态上不再是对立的，”正如Ilya Prigogine所说，“世界的各种意义和基本的不透明性都反映在新语言和新形式主义中。”</p>

8. The technological revolution received its fundamental impetus from the first industrial revolution in the nineteenth century. By starting up a process of mechanization, the industrial revolution triggered the phenomenon of crises of control. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> The mounting production levels resulting from mechanization led to the need for control systems to accelerate the flow of information. Researchers began to seek solutions in feedback techniques, automatic control systems, and information processing.<br>
技术革命从19世纪第一次工业革命那里获得了根本性的推动力。随着机械化的开展，工业革命扣响了控制危机这一现象的扳机。 [8]机械化带来的生产水平的递增激起了人们对控制系统的需求，以此来加速信息流动。研究人员开始在反馈技术、自动控制系统和信息处理方面寻求解决办法。</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<p>Under the title «On Governors» in 1868, Clerk Maxwell presented the first theoretical study towards an analysis of control and feedback mechanisms, so ushering in the radical transformation in automatic control engineering. By the late nineteenth century, a series of developments and technical innovations wereunderway that in the 1940s would serve as the basis of a new theory, namely cybernetics. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup><br>
1868年，在题为“On Governors”的一文中，Clerk Maxwell首次发表了对控制机制和反馈机制进行分析的理论研究，从而引发了自动控制工程领域的激进变革。到十九世纪后期，一系列的发展和技术革新正在进行，即将在20世纪40年代成为新理论的基础，即控制论。 [9]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The control revolution produced not only feedback techniques and a new hierarchization of media, but also revolutionized the cultural reproduction forms of society. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> This included areas like communications and art, since the technologies exercised a direct influence on the forms of sociocultural (re)production.<br>
控制革命不仅产生了反馈技术、造就了新的媒体分层，而且还革新了社会的文化再生产形式。 [10]这其中便包括了诸如通信和艺术等领域，因为这些技术直接影响到了社会文化（再）生产的形式。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until then, nevertheless, the themes associated with control mechanisms and automation were discussed in connection with only one common parameter, namely energy. As the basic concept of Newtonian mechanics, energy retained the same position in the natural sciences and in research fields like acoustics, electrical science, and optics. The invariant of ‹mass› similarly occupied a central position in physics. However, as production techniques continued to be improved, so the relationship of human and machine began to change likewise, leading to the emergence of questions about new terms and theories able to make this communication process between biological and technological systems the object of targeted research.<br>
而在那之前，与控制机制和自动化相关的主题只与一个通用参数有关，即能量。作为牛顿力学的基本概念，能量在自然科学、声学、电子科学和光学等研究领域保有同样的地位。 (mass)的不变性同样在物理学中占据了中心位置。然而，随着生产技术的不断完善，人与机器的关系也开始发生变化，导致出现了一些关于新术语和新理论的问题，这些新的术语和理论能使生物系统和技术系统之间的交流过程成为有针对性的研究对象。</p>

<p>That society can only be understood through a study of the messages and the communication facilities which belong to it; and that in the future development of these messages and communication facilities, messages between man and machines, between machines and man, and between machine and machine, are destined to play an ever increasing part,» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> was the key idea of the American mathematician Norbert Wiener (1894–1964), which he elaborated in his book «The Human Use of Human Beings. Cybernetics and Society,» published in 1950 after a first technical study «Cybernetic, or Control and Communication in the Animal and in the Machine» of 1948. In 1950 likewise, the British mathematician Alan Turing (1912–1954) raised the question of the feasibility of logical thought by machines. In his essay «Computing Machinery and Intelligence,» published in volume 59 of the philosophical journal «Mind,» Turing proceeds from the basic question with which his text begins: «Can machines think?»<br>
只有通过研究属于它的信息和通信设施才能理解“社会”；而且在这些信息和通信设施的未来发展中，人与机器之间，机器与人之间，机器与机器之间的信息注定将会发挥越来越大的作用，“[11]是美国重要思想家与数学家诺伯特·维纳（Norbert Wiener，1894-1964），在他的书《人类的人类使用，控制论与社会》一书中详细阐述了这一点。 该书于1950年发表，经过第一次技术研究《1948年动物和机器中的控制与沟通》之后。在1950年，同样，英国数学家艾伦图灵（1912-1954）提出了机器逻辑思维的可行性。在哲学杂志《心》”第59卷发表的论文«计算机械与情报»之中，图灵从他的文本开始的基本问题出发：“机器能思考吗？”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Until the mid-twentieth century no more than a few researchers working in isolation were concerned with subjects such as communication between dissimilar systems (for instance, biological and technical systems), or with the feasibility of technically designing thought machines. In addition to Wiener and Turing their ranks included Charles Babbage, Claude Shannon, Warren Weaver and Hermann Schmidt. However, from the 1950s on these subjects rapidly became two fields of basic research: cybernetics and Artificial Intelligence. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> The two aforementioned texts triggered a flood of publications containing speculation and analysis on these subjects. In the first three years after 1950 alone, more than a thousand essays published dealt with intelligence and with communication with and between machines. Yet, when Turing published his essay there existed no more than four digital computers worldwide (Mark I and EDSAC in England, ENIAC and BINAC in the USA). <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> Although Turing’s theorem—everything the human mind can do in the form of an algorithm can also be carried out by a Universal Turing Machine—was based on models so far investigated only as a hypothetical experiment, several researchers were inspired to empirically confirm or disprove it by building machines.<br>
一直到二十世纪中叶，只有很少的一部分研究人员在关注诸如不同系统（例如生物系统和技术系统）之间的通信或者从技术上设计思想机器的可行性等等主题。除了维纳和图灵之外，他们（学者）的队伍还包括查尔斯巴贝奇，克劳德香农，沃伦韦弗和赫尔曼施密特。然而，从20世纪50年代开始，这些主题迅速演变为基础研究的两个领域：控制论和人工智能。 [12]上述两篇文章引发了大量的出版物的出版，其中包括对这些主题的猜测和分析。在1950年以后的头三年之中，发表的论文超过一千篇，涉及智能和机器间的沟通。然而，当图灵发表他的文章时，世界上数字计算机不超过四台（英格兰的Mark I和EDSAC，美国的ENIAC和BINAC）。 [13]虽然图灵定理 - 人类大脑能够以算法的形式做的所有事情也可以通过通用图灵机来实现 - 基于迄今为止只作为假设实验进行过调查的模型，但几位研究人员受到启发以凭经验证实或者通过建造机器来进行反驳。</p>

<p>The approach of cybernetics—a name derived from the Greek term ‹kybernetes› (steersman)—consists in transferring the theory of control and message transmission, whether in the machine or in a living being, to the fields of communication and machine control. The objective is to investigate the relationships between animal and machine, and in the case of the machine the specific mode of its behavior, as a characteristic of the performance to be expected. [14]<br>
控制论的方法 —— 一个源于希腊语<kybernetes>（舵手）的名称 —— 将无论是在机器还是在生物体中的控制和信息传输理论，都转移到了信息交流与机器控制领域。其目的是调查分析动物和机器之间的关系，以及以机器的特定行为模式，作为预期性能的一个特征。[14]</kybernetes></p>

<p>On the basis of the observation of certain analogies between machines and living organisms, the mathematician asserts that no reason actually exists not to make a machine resemble a human being, since one and the other develop tendencies toward decreasing entropy, meaning that both are examples of local anti-entropic phenomena.<br>
在观察机器和生物体之间的某些相似性的基础上，数学家断言，实际上机器与人类是有理由相似的，因为他们都倾向于熵减，这意味着两者都有局部anti-entropic（反熵）的现象。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turing likewise conceded priority to the subject of communication. His famous experiment—the imitationgame, as he called it, also known as the Church-Turing thesis or Turing Theorem—for verifying the intelligence of a computer was concerned less with the actual construction of such a machine than with simulating with machines the human capability of communication. Turing was here acting in line with a tradition of measuring the faculty of thought by the ability to use human language. Descartes had already presented the logically semantic usage of language as a criterion for identifying thinking beings. For a long time, the mastery of semantics would remain a basic problem of Artificial Intelligence.<br>
图灵同样将重点放在交流上。 他著名的实验 —— 他称之为“模仿游戏”，也被称为Church-Turing thesis（丘奇-图灵论题）或Turing Theorem（图灵定理） —— 证明计算机的智能与机器模拟人沟通的能力相关，而不是与这种机器的实际构造相关。笛卡尔已经将语言的逻辑语义用法作为识别思维存在的标准。 在很长一段时间里，语义的掌握仍然是人工智能的一个基本问题。</p>

<p>In contrast to that tradition Wiener’s cybernetics sought operational ways of developing a specific language that would enable communication between dissimilar systems, and aimed to adapt semantics to specific goals in the process. Viewed from this perspective, Wiener’s theory replaced the notion of energy with that of information as the elementary parameter of communication, and thus postulated the definition of this new invariant for cybernetic science as a whole, which is a basic prerequisite for understanding the range of the cybernetic approach.<br>
与传统相反，Wiener’s（维纳的）控制论寻求开发一种能够在不同系统之间进行通信的特定语言的操作方式，并且旨在过程中使语义适应的特定的目标。从这个角度来看，Wiener’s（维纳的）理论用作为交流的基本参数的信息取代了能量的概念，并因此假定这个作为一个整体的新的控制论科学不变量的定义，这是理解控制论方法工作范围的一个基本先决条件。</p>

<p>Unlike Newton’s mechanics, which operates with closed systems, information is applied to open systems. In this way it must be seen as a key enabling linkage and communication between dissimilar systems, and between the latter and the external world. ‹Mass› and ‹energy› are directly related to matter in the natural sciences, whereas ‹information› is not conveyed by any substance, but is based on variable properties: Information can be reproduced (duplicated or copied), destroyed (erased), or reiterated (repeated). «Information is a name for the content of what is exchanged with the outer world as we adjust to it, and make our adjustment felt upon it. The process of receiving and of using information is the process of our adjusting to the contingencies of the outer environment, and of our living effectively within that environment.» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup> To this extent, not the possible quantity of circulating information is crucial to the effectiveness of communication, but the degree to which this information is integrated into communication. Along the lines of cybernetics, then,significant information is not the entirety of all information transmitted, but that information which passes through the ‹filters.›<br>
与牛顿的机械系统不同，该系统采用封闭系统运行，信息应用于开放系统。 通过这种方式，它必须被看作是不同系统之间以及后者与外部世界之间的关键连接和交流。 &lt;质量&gt;和&lt;能量&gt;与自然科学中的物质直接相关，&lt;信息&gt;不是由任何物质传递的，而是基于不同的属性：信息可以被复制（复制或拷贝），销毁（擦除） 或重申（重复）。“信息是我们在适应它时与外部世界交换内容的名称，并使我们的可以调整感受到它。 接收和使用信息的过程是我们适应外部环境的突发事件和调整我们在该环境中可以有效地生活的过程。“[14]在这种层面上，重要的不是大量传播信息对于交流的有效性，而是这种信息融入交流的程度。然后，根据控制论的观点，重要信息并不是所有信息的完整传递，而是通过&lt;过滤器&gt;的信息。<br>

<li>
<p>In the field of information and communication Wiener devoted particular attention to the question of automatons and the development of feedback models. His core interest lay in investigating machines capable of evaluating input and of integrating the stored experience into the further feedback loops. In this respect, feedback is a method of making systems self-regulating, by which the results of preceding activities are re-integrated in the procedural sequence and thus enable runtime corrections to be made permanently. To this end, machines must be capable of learning processes.<br>
在信息和通信领域，维纳特别关注自动机问题和反馈模型的发展。他的核心兴趣在于研究能够评估输入并将存储的体验整合到更多反馈环路的机器。在这方面，反馈是一种使系统自我调节的方法，通过该方法将前面活动的结果重新集成在过程序列当中，从而使在运行的同时修正可以够永久地持续下去。为此，机器必须能够学习过程。</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although his approaches and conclusions are very different from those of Wiener, Turing in his essay likewise clearly indicated the necessity of developing systems capable of learning. Devoted to the subject of learning machines, the essay takes as its starting point the principle that «education can take place provided that communication in both directions between teacher and pupil can take place by some means or other.» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup> Turing’s theory already aims at the need to create systems that guarantee for bi-directional communication of this kind. Necessary for this purpose are «unemotional channels of communication» over which it is possible to «teach a machine by punishments and rewards to obey orders given in some language, e.g., a symbolic language.» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup><br>
虽然他的方法和结论与维纳的方法和结论有很大不同，但图灵在他的论文中也清楚地表明了开发能够学习的系统的必要性。致力于学习机器的主题，这篇文章的出发点是“教育的前提是当教师和学生之间的双向沟通可以通过某种方式进行。”[15]。图灵的理论瞄准的是需要创建保证这种双向通信机制的系统。为此，非常必须的是“非情感的沟通渠道”，通过这种沟通渠道，可以实现“通过惩罚和奖励教导机器遵守某些语言给出的命令，例如象征性的语言”。[16]</p>

<li>
<p>Turing here went one step further than the feedback theory of Wiener, whose concept was confined to recursive processes within single systems. Turing, by contrast, conceived of a system capable oflearning and based on the exchange of information between human and machine. The approaches of the two mathematicians differ above all in the possibility of comparing systems. Norbert Wiener took as his point of departure the principle that a resemblance exists between living beings and machines, with the learning process being restricted to the acquisition of information and the ability to memorize the results of past operations for future usage. Alan Turing insisted that there was a difference between the behavior of the human nervous system, in which «chemical phenomena are at least as important as electrical» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup> and the capabilities of a discrete machine. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup> Machines «which move by sudden jumps or clicks from one quite definite state to another» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup> do not, strictly speaking, exist, since in reality everything is a constant process. This difference therefore makes impossible a direct connection between human beings and machines, and at the same time demands the development of a ‹channel› (interface) that initiates this communication. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup> Turing’s proposal was thus a decisive step towards the development of electronic interfaces for human-machine communication, and beyond that for the development of interactive, digital systems. This communication channel permits bi-directional information exchange, and therefore also learning processes. On the basis of this method, Turing repudiated the thesis set up by Ada Lovelace in 1842. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> Using investigations made with the ‹analytic machine› of Charles Babbage, Lady Lovelace had claimed that a machine can do only that which it is instructed to do, and therefore is never capable of producing anything truly new. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup> Turing contradicted this thesis with the question «who can be certain that ‹original work› that he has done was not simply the growth of the seed planted in him by teaching, or the effect of following well-known general principles?» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup> He further pointed out that the machine must be to a certain degree<br>
‹undisciplined› or random-controlled in order that its behavior can be considered intelligent. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup>Precisely this element of chance was what lent the machine ‹creative› ability, namely the ability to solve problems.<br>
图灵在这里比维纳的反馈理论更进一步，它的概念仅限于单个系统内的递归过程。相反，图灵构想了一个能够学习的系统，并基于人机交互信息。两位数学家的方法在比较系统的可能性上有所不同。诺伯特·维纳以他的出发点为基础，认为生物与机器之间存在相似之处，学习过程仅限于获取信息，并能够记忆过去操作的结果以备将来使用。艾伦图灵坚持认为人类神经系统的行为与“离散机器的能力”之间存在着差异，其中“化学现象至少与电力一样重要”[18]。 [^ 19]从严格意义上说，机器“突然跳跃或点击从一个相当确定的状态移动到另一个状态”[^ 20]并不存在，因为实际上一切都是一个连续的过程。因此，这种差异使得人与机器之间不可能直接连接，并且同时要求开发启动该通信的&lt;通道&gt;（接口）。因此，图灵的提案是开发用于人机通信的电子接口的决定性步骤，并超越了开发交互式数字系统的决心。该通信渠道允许双向信息交换，因此也允许学习过程。在这种方法的基础上，图灵驳斥了Ada Lovelace在1842年设立的论文。[^ 22]利用Charles Babbage的<analytic machine="">所做的调查，Lady Lovelace声称机器只能做到被指示去做，因此永远不会产生任何真正新的东西。图灵提出问题来反驳，“谁能够确信他所做的工作并不仅仅是教他种在他身上的种子的成长，还是遵循众所周知的一般原则的影响？ »[^ 24]他进一步指出，机器必须达到某种“无规律的”或者随机控制的程度，才可以被认为是智能的。 [^ 25]正是这种随机性是机器产生创造性的能力，即解决问题的能力。</analytic></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although discrete machines that could pass the Turing Test are feasible, they would succeed notbecause they were replicas of the human brain but because they would have been programmed accordingly. As Turing himself realized, the basic problem lies in the area of programming. In fact, it was not necessary to wait the fifty years assumed by Turing in order to program «computers, with a storage capacity of about 109, to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than a 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning.» <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup> The programs have been written, and have passed the Turing Test with a high degree of interactivity. One might therefore conclude that the problem is not solely confined to investigating the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence. <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">[26]</a></sup><br>
尽管可以通过图灵测试的分立机器是可行的，但它们会成功，不是因为它们是人脑的复制品，而是因为它们会被相应地编程。 正如图灵自己意识到的那样，基本问题在于编程领域。 事实上，没有必要等待图灵假定的50年来编程这样一个计算机“有109个储存器，能够很好的运行冒充(人类)的游戏，并使普通的询问着不会超过70%概率做出正确的判断”这些程序已经编写完成，并且已经通过了高互动性的的图灵测试。 有人可能因此得出结论：问题不仅仅局限于调查人工智能的可能性。</p>

<p>Viewed from the contemporary perspective, cybernetics and AI cannot be reduced to solely scientific, economic, or technical interest. Since these theories belong to a socio-technical field in which communication structures, world-views and people-views are formed and transformed, they are concerned with philosophic issues of perception, cognition, language, ethics, and aesthetics. If information technology is basically working towards the automation of mental processes, then it directly or indirectly reaches into disciplines concerned with human cognition or creativity.<br>
从当代角度来看，控制论和人工智能不能仅仅归结为科学，经济或技术的兴趣。 由于这些理论属于这样一个社会技术领域：在这个领域交流模式中，世界观和人们的观点被形成和转化，他们关心的是感知，认知，语言，伦理和美学等哲学问题。 如果信息技术基本上致力于心理过程的自动化，那么它直接或间接地涉及与人类认知或创造有关的学科。</p>

<p>Historical Space Every time you remember the past, the image in your head is that the natural one or it’s produced by the media? Media is a kind of memory that even redefined our natural function of memory? That’s what I want to say in this work. So I build a virtual pass time space memory by social media and some new data, that will show by the right time in current time, even though it’s used to.   <img src="http://47.106.34.239/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/historicalSpace-18-300x138.png" alt=""></p>
